# React Portfolio

## Description
This is a portfolio made with React and Bootstrap. It allowed me to learn about how pages are routed via React and how to implement changes to the virtual DOM. With this, I have demonstrated how things like adding many elements via props, setting active buttons through ternary operations, and building the React app.
